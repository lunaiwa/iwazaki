    "        > Lists and dictionaries are types of collections in programming. They are different from simple types because they are built using more advanced structures and methods. In Python, a list is like a flexible array, while a dictionary is like a key-value store. These collection types require more complex techniques to manage and organize data compared to simple types.\n",

    "        > When using bubble sort in Python, the list is passed by reference rather than by value. This means that when you pass a list as an argument to a function, you are actually passing a reference to the original list object, rather than creating a separate copy of the list. Any modifications made to the list within the function will affect the original list outside of the function as well. This can be useful for conserving memory and allowing changes to be visible outside of the function scope.\n",
