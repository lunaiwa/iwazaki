<li>Biggest discovery on Github is that you can find others so it's like a social media for code</li>
<li>Can make SCRUM boards and see what others have commited in a repository</li>
<li>The history of commits and other things can be seen by others</li>

<p>HP Computers:</p>
<ul>
<li>It wasn't intentional because they didn't test well and they didn't use enough testers for their program. In the end the program turned unintnetionally racist </li>
<li>To produce a better outcome I would test with a wider variety of testers</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the computer bias is mostly not intentional. CHAT GPT is unintentional and just used the websites in it's own algorithm. Most of the computer algorithms are not bias becuase they can be it's becuase they cannot be bias. THey just use whatever come up into their algorithm. But, testing can also affect the outcomes. Like the HP testing they couldn't test on different types of people with different types of skin colors. Computers are just told what they are supposed to do and what they are max capable of.</p>

<p>What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?:</p>

<p>Yes, the project can be better with crowd sourcing. In fact some of the ideas that were sourced from the classmates during last project presentations were implemented into our project. But, crowd sourcing in Del Norte might be worse since many high schoolers are probably not thinking about buying a car. This means we need a different crowd to present this to, the adults for example, because they are far more likely to buy a car.</p>

<p>Data that my part of the project can collect is the email data. I can have viewers look at my part of the website and insert heir email into my subscriptions part of the site. I can collect data as to what types of emails I recive (e.g. @gmail, @yahoo, ect.).</p>
